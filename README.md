# Polish version of Twenty-One game...(simplified :-)) in polish “Oczko”

This is my first web game, written in JavaScript. After extensive learning of JS I wrote the polish version of BlackJack. This is two player version only without any RWD scaling, good to display on 16:9 screen the best on 1920*1080px. In the future I will prepare mobile version. I will also rewrite the code using objects and classes. This project was wrotten only using functions and arrays and variables mostly.

The rules of that game are very easy.  The purpose of that game is to reach 21 points without without going over.  The only one exception is, when you obtain two Aces in the the first and second round, you win as well and it does not matter that you gained 22 points. The two aces always wins, even if the opponent reach 21 points in the first two round. It could happend that both players collect two aces. It is a very low probability that it will happend, but I programmed it as a draw.

The game is played with standard 52 card deck with Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. The value of each card from 2-10 is the value of the card. The value of the Jack is 2 points, the value of the Queen is 3 points and the value of the King is 4 points. The Ace in this option has always the value of 11 points.

To play the game:

1.Press Start (START GRY);<br>
2.Start taking cards, by pressing Take Card (WEŹ KARTĘ);

If you are close to 21 points or in any moment you can collect the points and pass or go ahead. Remember, that if you go over 21 points you automatically loose. If you reach, exactly 21 points, you need to pass and you wait until your opponent pass. If your oponent reach as well 21 points it is a draw, if he goes over 21, you win. 

I hope you like it :-)
