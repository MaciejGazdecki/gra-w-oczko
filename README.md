# Polish version of Twenty-One game...(simplified :-)) in polish “Oczko”

This is my first web game, written in JavaScript. After extensive learning of JS I wrote the polish version of BlackJack. This is one player version only without any RWD scaling, good to display on 16:9 screen the best on 1920*1080px. In the future I will prepare mobile version.  The game was developed as well and I created a two player version on another branch. The rules of that game are very easy.  The purpose of that game is to reach 21 points without without going over.  The only one exception is, when you obtain two Aces in the the first and second round, you win as well and it does not matter that you gained 22 points. The game is played with standard 52 card deck with Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. The value of each card from 2-10 is the value of the card. The value of the Jack is 2 points, the value of the Queen is 3 points and the value of the King is 4 points. The Ace in this option has always the value of 11 points.

To play the game:

1.Press Start (START GRY);<br>
2.Start taking cards, by pressing Take Card (WEŹ KARTĘ);

If you are close to 21 points or in any moment you can collect the pints or go ahead. Remember, that if you pass 21 points you loose. If you reach, exactly 21 points, you win and you need just press collect points. The final score of the each won game (without passing 21 points) will be recorded and displayed. I added as well an average score of each won game.

I hope you like it :-)
